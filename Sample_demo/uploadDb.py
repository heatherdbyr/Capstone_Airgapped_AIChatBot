If you don't see Focused and Other in your mailbox, you might have a Clutter folder instead. The Focused Inbox REST API provides Microsoft 365 mailbox message classification and training to help users sort their email efficiently. However, this API isn't supported for the Microsoft 365 Shared mailbox. Outlook for Windows currently displays \"Focused Inbox\" hints for shared mailboxes. This is unexpected behavior. Microsoft is aware of the problem, and this article will be updated after changes are complete."
